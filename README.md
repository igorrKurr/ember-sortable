Sortable UI primitives for Ember.

[Check out the demo](http://jgwhite.co.uk/ember-sortable/demo)

## Requirements

Version 1.0 depends upon the availability of 2D CSS transforms.
Check [the matrix on caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#feat=transforms2d)
to see if your target browsers are compatible.

## Installation

```sh
$ ember install ember-sortable
```

## Usage

```js
// app/routes/my-route.js

export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model() {
    return {
      items: [
        { name: 'Uno' },
        { name: 'Dos' },
        { name: 'Tres' },
        { name: 'Cuatro' },
        { name: 'Cinco' }
      ]
    };
  },

  actions: {
    reorderItems(newOrder) {
      this.set('currentModel.items', newOrder);
    }
  }
});
```

```hbs
{{! app/templates/my-route.hbs }}

{{#sortable-group tagName="ul" onChange="reorderItems" as |group|}}
  {{#each model.items as |item|}}
    {{#sortable-item tagName="li" model=item group=group handle=".handle"}}
      {{item.name}}
      <span class="handle">&varr;</span>
    {{/sortable-item}}
  {{/each}}
{{/sortable-group}}
```

To change sorting direction:

```hbs
...

{{#sortable-group direction="x" onChange="reorderItems" as |group|}} // default direction is 'y'
...
```

### Notes on Usage

No data is mutated by `sortable-group` or `sortable-item`. In the spirit of “data down, actions up”, a fresh array containing the models from each item in their new order is sent via the group’s `onChange` action.

`sortable-group` yields itself to the block so that it may be assigned explicitly to each item’s `group` property. While it would be technically possible to automatically discover the parent group, we feel establishing this relationship explicitly is clearer. Feedback welcome.

Each item takes a `model` property. This should be fairly self-explanatory but it’s important to note that it doesn’t do anything with this object besides keeping a reference for later use in `onChange`.

## CSS

Sortable items can be in one of three states: default, dragging, dropping.
The classes look like this:

```html
<!-- Default -->
<li class="sortable-item">...</li>
<!-- Dragging -->
<li class="sortable-item is-dragging">...</li>
<!-- Dropping -->
<li class="sortable-item is-dropping">...</li>
```

In our [example app.css](tests/dummy/app/styles/app.css) we apply a
transition of `.125s` in the default case:

```css
.sortable-item {
  transition: all .125s;
}
```

While an item is dragging we want it to move pixel-for-pixel with the
user’s mouse so we bring the transition duration to 0. We also give
it a highlight color and bring it to the top of the stack:

```css
.sortable-item.is-dragging {
  transition-duration: 0s;
  background: red;
  z-index: 10;
}
```

While dropping, the `is-dragging` class is removed and the item returns to its default transition duration. If we wanted to apply a
different duration we could do so with the `is-dropping` class. In
our example we opt to simply maintain the z-index and apply a
slightly different colour:

```css
.sortable-item.is-dropping {
  background: #f66;
  z-index: 10;
}
```
